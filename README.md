# Smart-Fence
Smart Fence is an IoT-based Border Control and Monitoring System.
The project involves a smart fence system using an ESP8266 microcontroller, YOLO object detection, and Blynk integration.
The system detects intruders in real-time using a web camera and the YOLO algorithm, triggering alerts through LED lights, a buzzer, and a servo motor.
